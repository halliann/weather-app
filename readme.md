<!-- TO DO -->

<!-- PART I -->
- Functions that fetch API - can take a location and return the weather data for that location.

- Functions that process JSON data from the API and return an object with only data required for app.

- Create form that lets users input their location and will fetch weather info.

- Display the information on webpage using the DOM.



<!-- PART II -->
- Should be able to select the area as a ‘saved’ or ‘home’ area.

- Create a class SelectedAreas that holds the list of saved areas (should have a method for adding and removing selected areas).

- A button for refetching weather information for selected areas (add a timestamp to the last update for selected areas’ data).

<!-- BONUS -->
- Add a ‘loading’ component that displays from the time the form is submitted until the information comes back from the API.
